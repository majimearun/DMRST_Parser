0. [Optional] If you want to conduct the EDU-level cross-translation augmentation, you can use machine translation engines to process the *.edu files (from a source language to a target language).  
As each row in *.edu files is one EDU segment, please keep the same row number/row order before and after translation.


1. MUL_generate_input_pkl_XLMR.py  

    To generate all pickle files for discourse parsing Framework.

* input_base_path: the data path of each translated language (the folder includes *.edus file and *.dmrg file).  
* output_base_path: the data path of generated pickle files.

2. split_train_test_pickle.py  

    To split training and testing pickle files.

* input: the path of the pickle files generated by the MUL_generate_input_pkl_XLMR.py
